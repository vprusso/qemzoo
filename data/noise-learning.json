    "summary": "Learns a sparse noise model by representing errors as low-weight Pauli operators in a Lindblad master equation. The sparsity assumption (weight \\(\\leq 2\\), geometrically local) reduces parameters from \\(O(4^{2n})\\) to \\(O(n \\cdot 4^w)\\), enabling scalable learning and inversion. Captures correlated noise including crosstalk. Used in the 127-qubit utility demonstration.",
