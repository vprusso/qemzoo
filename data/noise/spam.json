  "description": [
    "SPAM (State Preparation And Measurement) errors occur at the beginning and end of a quantum computation, before and after the main circuit. Unlike gate errors, SPAM errors do not scale with circuit depth.",
    "State preparation errors cause the initial state to deviate from the intended |0⟩⊗n. This can arise from thermal population, insufficient reset, or T1 decay during initialization.",
    "Measurement errors cause the final state to be misidentified: |0⟩ may be reported as 1 (false positive) or |1⟩ as 0 (false negative). Readout fidelities of 99%+ are typical, but errors compound across many qubits."
