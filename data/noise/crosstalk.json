  "description": [
    "Crosstalk refers to unwanted interactions between qubits that cause operations on one qubit to affect neighboring qubits. This is a major error source in multi-qubit systems and becomes increasingly problematic as qubit counts grow.",
    "In superconducting qubits, always-on ZZ coupling is a dominant form of crosstalk: even when no gate is applied, neighboring qubits accumulate a conditional phase. In trapped ions, crosstalk arises from imperfect addressing of individual ions.",
    "Crosstalk errors are typically coherent and correlated across qubits, making them difficult to model and mitigate with techniques designed for independent, stochastic errors."
