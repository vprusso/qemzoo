  "description": [
    "Dephasing (also called phase damping or T2 decay) describes the loss of quantum coherence without energy exchange. The off-diagonal elements of the density matrix decay exponentially while the diagonal elements (populations) remain unchanged.",
    "Physically, dephasing arises from fluctuations in the qubit's energy splitting, causing the phase to undergo a random walk. This is the dominant decoherence mechanism in many qubit platforms and is characterized by the T2 coherence time.",
    "Pure dephasing (T2*) refers to inhomogeneous dephasing from static frequency variations, while T2 includes both pure dephasing and contributions from T1 relaxation: 1/T2 = 1/(2T1) + 1/T2*."
