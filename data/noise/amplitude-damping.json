  "description": [
    "Amplitude damping describes the irreversible loss of energy from a qubit, causing decay from the excited state |1⟩ to the ground state |0⟩. This is the quantum analog of classical dissipation and is characterized by the T1 relaxation time.",
    "Unlike dephasing, amplitude damping is asymmetric: it preferentially drives the qubit toward |0⟩. This breaks the symmetry between computational basis states and cannot be described as a Pauli channel.",
    "In superconducting qubits, T1 is typically limited by dielectric losses, quasiparticle tunneling, or coupling to spurious two-level systems. T1 times of 100-500 μs are common in modern transmon qubits."
