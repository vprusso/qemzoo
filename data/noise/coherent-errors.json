  "description": [
    "Coherent errors are deterministic, unitary deviations from the intended gate operation. Unlike stochastic Pauli errors, coherent errors are systematic and can accumulate constructively, potentially causing error rates that scale quadratically with circuit depth rather than linearly.",
    "Common examples include over-rotation (applying Rz(θ + δ) instead of Rz(θ)), axis tilts (rotating about a slightly wrong axis), and phase errors from frequency miscalibration.",
    "Coherent errors are particularly insidious because they can evade detection by methods designed for stochastic errors. However, they can be converted to stochastic errors through randomized compiling (Pauli twirling)."
