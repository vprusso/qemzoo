  "description": [
    "Leakage errors occur when a qubit transitions from the computational subspace (|0\u27e9, |1\u27e9) to higher energy levels (|2\u27e9, |3\u27e9, ...) of the physical system. Unlike erasure, leakage is typically not heralded \u2014 the qubit remains in the system but occupies a state outside the intended two-level subspace, and subsequent gates may behave unpredictably.",
    "Leakage is particularly problematic in superconducting transmon qubits, where the weak anharmonicity (~200\u2013300 MHz) means that drive pulses intended for the 0\u21921 transition can excite the 1\u21922 transition. Multi-qubit gates (e.g., cross-resonance, iSWAP) are especially susceptible to leakage because they involve strong driving fields.",
    "Once a qubit has leaked, it can propagate errors to neighboring qubits through entangling gates, causing correlated failures that are difficult to diagnose. Leakage reduction units (LRUs) \u2014 reset operations that return leaked qubits to the computational subspace \u2014 are a common hardware-level mitigation."
