  "description": [
    "The erasure channel models the complete loss of a qubit, where the qubit transitions to a detectable non-computational state |e\u27e9. Unlike other noise channels, the location of an erasure error is known (heralded) because the qubit is flagged as lost, making erasure errors significantly easier to correct than general Pauli errors.",
    "Erasure is the dominant error mechanism in photonic quantum computing (photon loss) and is increasingly relevant in neutral atom arrays where atoms can be lost from optical traps. Recent work has shown that certain superconducting qubit architectures can be engineered to convert leakage into detectable erasure, dramatically improving error correction thresholds.",
    "The erasure threshold for quantum error correction is approximately 50% per qubit, compared to roughly 11% for depolarizing noise, making erasure-dominated systems attractive for fault-tolerant quantum computing."
