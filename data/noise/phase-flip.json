  "description": [
    "The phase flip channel randomly applies a Pauli Z operation with probability p, flipping the relative phase between |0\u27e9 and |1\u27e9. It is the Hadamard-conjugate of the bit flip channel: a phase flip in the computational basis is equivalent to a bit flip in the Hadamard (X) basis.",
    "While the populations (diagonal elements) of the density matrix remain unchanged, the off-diagonal coherences are damped by a factor of (1-2p). At p=0.5, all coherence is destroyed and the channel becomes a full Z-dephasing channel.",
    "The phase flip channel is a Pauli channel and can be exactly corrected by PEC with a known error rate. It is also naturally suppressed by dynamical decoupling sequences that refocus Z-type errors."
