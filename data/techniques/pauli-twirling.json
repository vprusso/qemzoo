  "description": [
    "Pauli Twirling (PT), also known as randomized compiling, converts coherent (systematic) gate errors into stochastic Pauli noise. Coherent errors are particularly problematic because they can accumulate constructively, leading to worst-case error scaling. Stochastic Pauli errors, by contrast, add incoherently and are easier to analyze and mitigate.",
    "The technique works by conjugating each gate with random Pauli operators drawn from the gate's stabilizer group. Because the Pauli operators commute with the ideal gate (up to a phase that is tracked classically), the ideal computation is unchanged, but the effective noise channel is symmetrized (twirled) into a Pauli channel.",
    "Pauli twirling is most commonly used as a preprocessing step before applying ZNE or PEC, where the simplified Pauli noise structure makes the downstream mitigation more effective."

  "how_it_works": [
    "For each two-qubit gate \\(G\\) in the circuit, randomly sample Pauli operators \\(P_L, P_R\\) from the twirling group such that \\(P_R \\, G \\, P_L = e^{i\\phi} G\\) (the phase \\(\\phi\\) is tracked classically).",
    "Replace each gate \\(G\\) with the sequence \\(P_R \\, G \\, P_L\\) and absorb the tracked phase into the final expectation value.",
    "Repeat this randomization for many independent circuit instances (typically 10–100 twirled copies).",
    "Average the results. The averaging symmetrizes the noise channel into a Pauli channel, eliminating off-diagonal (coherent) error components."

    "notes": "Pauli twirling does not reduce the total noise magnitude — it only reshapes the noise. The 'bias' is unchanged in terms of total error, but the noise becomes stochastic, which is easier to handle with ZNE/PEC. Low overhead from averaging over twirled instances."

    "Converts worst-case (coherent) errors into average-case (stochastic) errors",

  "disadvantages": [
    "Does not reduce total noise on its own — only changes its structure",
    "Requires multiple circuit instances for averaging",
