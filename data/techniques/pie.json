  "description": [
    "Physics-Inspired Extrapolation (PIE) performs zero-noise extrapolation using a theoretically motivated fitting function derived from the EMRE framework, rather than the heuristic polynomial or exponential models used in standard ZNE. The key innovation is that PIE's extrapolation model has operationally meaningful parameters: the intercept gives the ideal expectation value, and the slope of the linear fit (in log-scale) directly corresponds to the max-relative entropy between the ideal and noisy quantum circuits.",
    "Unlike standard ZNE where the choice of fitting model is a heuristic decision with no guarantee of correctness, PIE's fitting function is derived from the theoretical structure of the generalized quasi-probability decomposition (GQPD) used in EMRE. For a circuit folded to noise amplification level \\(\\lambda\\), the noisy expectation value follows \\(f(\\lambda) = \\langle O \\rangle_{\\text{ideal}} \\cdot s^{-\\lambda}\\), which linearizes to \\(\\ln f(\\lambda) = \\ln \\langle O \\rangle_{\\text{ideal}} - \\lambda \\ln s\\) in log-space.",
    "PIE also provides simultaneous hardware certification at no additional cost: the slope parameter \\(\\ln s\\) directly quantifies the operational distance (max-relative entropy) between ideal and noisy circuits. The technique was validated on IBM quantum hardware and applied to simulate 84-qubit quantum dynamics on an IBM Eagle processor."

  "how_it_works": [
    "Prepare the quantum circuit at increasing noise levels by applying unitary folding (inserting \\(G \\cdot G^\\dagger\\) pairs). The noise amplification levels are \\(\\lambda = 1, 3, 5, 7, \\ldots\\) (odd integers corresponding to 0, 1, 2, 3 foldings).",
    "For each noise level \\(\\lambda\\), execute the folded circuit and measure the expectation value \\(\\langle O \\rangle_\\lambda\\). Typically 4 data points are sufficient.",
    "Convert expectation values to log-scale: compute \\(\\ln \\langle O \\rangle_\\lambda\\) for each data point.",
    "Fit the transformed data to the linear model \\(\\ln f(\\lambda) = \\ln \\langle O \\rangle_{\\text{ideal}} - \\lambda \\ln s\\) using standard linear regression.",
    "The y-intercept at \\(\\lambda = 0\\) gives the error-mitigated estimate. Exponentiate to obtain \\(\\langle O \\rangle_{\\text{ideal}}\\).",
    "The fitted slope \\(-\\ln s\\) directly provides the max-relative entropy \\(D_{\\max}(\\mathcal{U} \\| \\mathcal{E} \\circ \\mathcal{U})\\), quantifying the operational distance between ideal and noisy circuits (hardware certification)."
