    "Twirled Readout Error eXtinction (TREX) is a model-free readout error mitigation technique that avoids the exponential cost of full confusion-matrix inversion. Instead of characterizing the full \\(2^n \\times 2^n\\) assignment matrix, TREX uses randomized bit flips before measurement to diagonalize the readout noise channel.",
    "TREX is implemented as resilience level 1 in IBM's Qiskit Runtime. It is particularly attractive because it requires no prior characterization of the readout noise and adds minimal overhead.",
    "The key insight is that applying a uniformly random Pauli-X bit flip to each qubit before measurement, and tracking the flip classically, transforms an arbitrary readout-error channel into a diagonal (multiplicative) channel. Each Pauli observable then picks up a single multiplicative bias factor that can be estimated and divided out."
  ],
  "how_it_works": [
    "For each shot, independently and uniformly at random, decide whether to apply a Pauli-X gate to each qubit immediately before measurement.",
    "Record the random bit-flip pattern alongside the measurement outcome.",
    "In classical post-processing, undo the known bit flips to recover the intended measurement result.",
    "The random twirling diagonalizes the readout-error transfer matrix: each Pauli observable \\(P\\) acquires a multiplicative factor \\(\\lambda_P\\).",
    "Estimate \\(\\lambda_P\\) from calibration circuits (e.g., preparing \\(|0\\rangle^{\\otimes n}\\)) and divide the raw expectation value by \\(\\lambda_P\\) to obtain the corrected result."

  "advantages": [
    "Model-free: no need to characterize the full readout-error matrix",

    "Scales well to large qubit counts",
    "Composable with gate-noise mitigation techniques (ZNE, PEC, etc.)"

  "disadvantages": [
    "Only addresses readout errors, not gate errors",
    "Correction accuracy depends on stability of readout-error rates between calibration and experiment",
    "Division by small \\(\\lambda_P\\) amplifies statistical noise for high-weight Pauli observables"
