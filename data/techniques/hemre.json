    "Hybrid Error Mitigation by Restricted Evolution (HEMRE) interpolates continuously between PEC and EMRE, forming a parametric family of mitigation strategies. The key innovation is an adjustable bias tolerance parameter \\(\\Delta_{\\text{fixed}}\\) that controls which gates receive full PEC treatment and which receive the cheaper EMRE approximation.",
    "Gates whose generalized robustness is below the bias threshold are treated with EMRE (implementable approximation), while gates with higher robustness receive the full quasi-probability decomposition (PEC). This creates a spectrum of protocols: at \\(\\Delta_{\\text{fixed}} = 0\\), HEMRE reduces to PEC; as \\(\\Delta_{\\text{fixed}} \\to \\infty\\), it reduces to EMRE.",
    "HEMRE is particularly powerful in moderate-noise regimes where neither pure EMRE (too much bias) nor pure PEC (too much sampling overhead) is optimal. Numerical simulations show that HEMRE outperforms both pure methods across a wide range of noise levels, making it the most practically flexible member of this protocol family."

  "how_it_works": [
    "Set a maximum tolerable bias \\(\\Delta_{\\text{fixed}}\\) for the estimation.",
    "For each gate layer, compute the generalized robustness \\(s_i\\) and rank gates by their robustness values.",
    "Partition gates into two sets: EMRE-treated gates (low robustness, replaced with closest implementable operation) and PEC-treated gates (remaining gates receiving full quasi-probability decomposition).",
    "The partition satisfies the constraint \\(s_{\\text{incl}} \\leq \\Delta_{\\text{fixed}} + 1 - \\epsilon\\), where \\(s_{\\text{incl}}\\) is the product of robustness factors for EMRE-treated gates.",
    "Execute the hybrid circuit: for PEC-treated gates, sample from the quasi-probability decomposition; for EMRE-treated gates, use the implementable approximation directly.",
    "Weight measurement outcomes by the product of the PEC coefficients and EMRE scaling factors."
