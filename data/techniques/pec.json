  "description": [
    "Probabilistic Error Cancellation (PEC) is the canonical quantum error mitigation technique that yields an unbiased estimator of the ideal expectation value for gate errors. The price for this exactness is an exponential sampling overhead.",
    "The key insight is that the ideal (noiseless) operation can be expressed as a linear combination of noisy implementable operations with real-valued (possibly negative) quasi-probability coefficients. By sampling noisy circuits according to the absolute values of these coefficients and weighting results by their signs, the ideal expectation value is recovered in expectation.",
    "PEC was proposed simultaneously with ZNE and requires a detailed noise model, typically obtained via gate set tomography or cycle benchmarking."

    "Characterize the noise channel \\(\\mathcal{E}_i\\) for each gate \\(G_i\\) in the circuit, so that the noisy implementation is \\(\\mathcal{N}_i = \\mathcal{E}_i \\circ \\mathcal{G}_i\\).",
    "Decompose each ideal gate as \\(\\mathcal{G}_i = \\sum_\\alpha \\eta_{i,\\alpha} \\, \\mathcal{O}_{i,\\alpha}\\) where \\(\\mathcal{O}_{i,\\alpha}\\) are implementable noisy operations and \\(\\eta_{i,\\alpha}\\) are quasi-probability coefficients (can be negative).",
    "For each circuit sample: randomly choose an operation \\(\\mathcal{O}_{i,\\alpha}\\) for each gate with probability \\(|\\eta_{i,\\alpha}| / C_i\\) where \\(C_i = \\sum_\\alpha |\\eta_{i,\\alpha}|\\).",
    "Execute the sampled circuit and weight the measurement result by the product of signs \\(\\prod_i \\text{sgn}(\\eta_{i,\\alpha_i})\\) and the total one-norm \\(\\prod_i C_i\\).",
    "Average over many samples to estimate the ideal expectation value."
