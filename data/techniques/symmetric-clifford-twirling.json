  "description": [
    "Symmetric Clifford Twirling (SCT) is a refined twirling technique that uses only symmetric Clifford operators — those that commute with certain Pauli subgroups associated with the target operation. This structure-preserving approach scrambles noise to approximately global white noise with exponential precision while maintaining the operation's inherent symmetries.",
    "The key insight is that full Clifford twirling, while powerful, can destroy useful structure in quantum circuits. By restricting to symmetric Cliffords, SCT achieves the noise-averaging benefits of twirling while preserving properties essential for error mitigation in structured circuits like those used in Hamiltonian simulation.",
    "SCT is particularly relevant for the early fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) regime, where non-Clifford operations must be executed without full error correction. In this regime, the cost of error mitigation scales with the 'non-Cliffordness' of the circuit, and SCT provides cost-optimal mitigation by exploiting symmetry structure."

    "Construct the set of symmetric Clifford operators: those Cliffords \\(C\\) satisfying \\([C, P] = 0\\) for all \\(P \\in \\mathcal{P}\\).",
    "For each gate layer, randomly sample symmetric Clifford twirling pairs \\((C_L, C_R)\\) and apply them before and after the layer.",
    "Execute the twirled circuit and collect measurement outcomes.",
    "Average over many randomized instances. The noise is scrambled to global white noise (depolarizing) with exponentially small deviations.",
    "Hardware-efficient variant: use only local symmetric Cliffords to reduce gate overhead while maintaining noise scrambling."
