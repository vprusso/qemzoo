  "description": [
    "Adaptive KIK is a quantum error mitigation technique that uses pulse-based inverse evolutions to cancel noise effects. The name 'KIK' describes the circuit structure: K (original circuit) \u2192 Inverse \u2192 K, where the inverse is constructed at the pulse level rather than the gate level. Unlike gate-level approaches (such as unitary folding in ZNE), KIK constructs the inverse by reversing pulse amplitudes and time ordering.",
    "The key innovation is the adaptive coefficient: rather than using fixed linear combinations, the method tunes its coefficients based on the noise level of the target device. This allows KIK to handle moderate-to-strong noise regimes where standard ZNE with circuit folding fails.",
    "When combined with randomized compiling, Adaptive KIK can handle both incoherent and coherent noise, including spatially correlated and time-dependent noise. The method requires no tomographic characterization or machine learning, and the number of quantum circuits needed is independent of system size, making it practically scalable."

    "The adaptive coefficients are chosen to minimize the error based on the observed noise level, rather than being fixed a priori."
