  "description": [
    "Crosstalk-Adaptive Scheduling (CAS) is a suppression technique that mitigates crosstalk errors \u2014 unwanted interactions between qubits when gates are executed in parallel \u2014 by intelligently scheduling gate operations to avoid simultaneous execution on high-crosstalk qubit pairs.",
    "The method has been demonstrated on 20-qubit IBM systems, achieving up to 5.6x error reduction compared to default scheduling. The approach first characterizes crosstalk via simultaneous randomized benchmarking, then formulates scheduling as a constrained optimization problem.",
    "The key trade-off is between serialization (which avoids crosstalk but extends circuit duration, increasing decoherence) and parallelism (which minimizes duration but exposes the circuit to crosstalk). The scheduler balances these competing effects."
  ],
  "how_it_works": [
    "Characterize crosstalk between qubit pairs using simultaneous randomized benchmarking (SRB): measure how error rates change when gates are executed in parallel vs. isolation.",
    "Build a crosstalk map identifying which qubit pairs have significant crosstalk.",
    "Formulate gate scheduling as a constrained optimization: minimize total circuit duration subject to the constraint that high-crosstalk gate pairs are not executed simultaneously.",
    "Apply the optimized schedule to the circuit, serializing only the operations that would cause significant crosstalk.",
    "Execute the scheduled circuit on hardware."
