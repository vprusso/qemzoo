  "description": [
    "Robust Shadow Estimation (RSE) extends the classical shadow protocol of Huang, Kueng, and Preskill to be resilient against experimental noise. The key idea is to add a calibration stage that characterizes the noisy measurement channel, then use the calibrated inverse instead of the ideal inverse when constructing classical shadows.",
    "The method provides unbiased estimates of observables with sample complexity matching standard shadows up to a noise-dependent multiplicative factor, requiring only minimal assumptions on the noise.",
    "RSE is particularly valuable in settings where many observables must be estimated from the same quantum state, as the calibration cost is amortized across all observables."

  "how_it_works": [
    "Run a calibration stage: prepare a set of known input states and measure them through the noisy measurement channel to characterize the effective noise.",
    "Construct the calibrated channel inverse from the calibration data.",
    "Execute the target quantum circuit and perform randomized measurements (random Pauli or Clifford bases).",
    "Apply the calibrated inverse (instead of the ideal inverse) to construct noise-robust classical shadows.",
    "Estimate any desired observables from the robust shadows using standard median-of-means estimation."
