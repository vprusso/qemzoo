  "description": [
    "The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for finding the ground state energy of a molecular Hamiltonian. It uses a parameterized quantum circuit (ansatz) to prepare trial wavefunctions, measures the energy expectation value, and classically optimizes the parameters.",
    "VQE is one of the most promising near-term applications of quantum computing for quantum chemistry, with potential applications in drug discovery, materials science, and catalysis.",
    "Chemical accuracy (errors < 1.6 mHa or ~1 kcal/mol) is required for practically useful predictions. Achieving this on NISQ devices requires sophisticated error mitigation strategies."
  ],
  "why_qem": [
    "VQE circuits for chemically interesting molecules require significant depth, making them susceptible to noise. Even small errors in energy estimates can lead to qualitatively wrong predictions about molecular properties.",
    "Symmetry verification is particularly powerful for VQE because molecular Hamiltonians conserve particle number, spin, and spatial symmetries. Measurements violating these symmetries can be discarded or corrected.",
    "N-representability constraints from quantum chemistry provide additional physical constraints that can be used to project noisy reduced density matrices onto the physically allowed manifold.",
    "Zero-noise extrapolation and Clifford data regression leverage the structure of VQE circuits to learn and correct systematic errors."
