  "description": [
    "Exponential extrapolation fits an exponential decay model to the measured data, motivated by the physical observation that expectation values often decay exponentially with circuit depth or noise strength.",
    "The most common form is ⟨O⟩(λ) = A·exp(-Bλ) + C, where A, B, C are fitting parameters. This three-parameter model requires at least three data points and captures the asymptotic decay toward a noise-dominated fixed point.",
    "Exponential extrapolation often outperforms polynomial methods for deep circuits where the true decay is closer to exponential than polynomial."

  "how_it_works": [
    "Measure expectation values at three or more noise levels λ₁, λ₂, λ₃, ...",
    "Fit the exponential model ⟨O⟩(λ) = A·exp(-Bλ) + C using nonlinear least squares.",
    "The zero-noise estimate is ⟨O⟩(0) = A + C.",
    "Alternative: fit ⟨O⟩(λ) = A·exp(Bλ) if decay constant B is expected to be positive."

  "advantages": [
    "Physically motivated for many noise processes",
    "Often more accurate than polynomials for deep circuits",
    "Naturally bounded (doesn't extrapolate to unphysical values)",
    "More stable than high-order polynomials",
    "Only 3 parameters for the full model"
  ],
  "disadvantages": [
    "Requires nonlinear fitting (more complex than polynomial)",
    "May not converge if data doesn't follow exponential trend",
    "Three parameters require at least 3 data points",
    "Assumes specific functional form that may not match all noise types",
    "Initial guess sensitivity in nonlinear fitting"
