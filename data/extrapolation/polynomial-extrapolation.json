  "description": [
    "Polynomial extrapolation fits a polynomial function to expectation values measured at multiple noise levels, then evaluates the polynomial at zero noise. Higher-degree polynomials can capture more complex noise dependencies but require more data points and risk overfitting.",
    "The method is motivated by Taylor expansion: if ⟨O⟩(λ) is analytic in λ, it can be approximated by a polynomial near λ = 0. The degree of the polynomial determines the order of the error term in the extrapolation.",
    "In practice, quadratic (degree-2) or cubic (degree-3) polynomials are most common. Higher degrees rarely improve results due to increased variance and numerical instability."

  "how_it_works": [
    "Measure expectation values ⟨O⟩ᵢ at n+1 distinct noise levels λ₀, λ₁, ..., λₙ for a degree-n polynomial.",
    "Fit the polynomial ⟨O⟩(λ) = a₀ + a₁λ + a₂λ² + ... + aₙλⁿ using least squares or Lagrange interpolation.",
    "The zero-noise estimate is ⟨O⟩(0) = a₀.",
    "For exact interpolation with n+1 points and degree n, the fit passes through all data points."
