  "description": [
    "Richardson extrapolation is a classical numerical analysis technique that systematically eliminates leading-order error terms by combining estimates at different step sizes (or in our case, noise levels). It is mathematically equivalent to polynomial extrapolation but provides a more structured approach.",
    "The key insight is that if the error expands as a power series in λ, then taking appropriate linear combinations of measurements at different λ values can cancel successive error terms. This is the basis for many high-precision numerical methods.",
    "In the QEM context, Richardson extrapolation provides a systematic way to improve ZNE accuracy by using measurements at geometrically-spaced noise levels (e.g., λ = 1, 2, 4 or λ = 1, 3, 5)."

  "how_it_works": [
    "Assume the expectation value has an error expansion: ⟨O⟩(λ) = ⟨O⟩₀ + c₁λ + c₂λ² + c₃λ³ + ...",
    "Measure at noise levels λ₁ < λ₂ < ... < λₙ (often geometric: λₖ = λ₁ · rᵏ⁻¹).",
    "Combine measurements with weights chosen to cancel the first n-1 error terms.",
    "The result has error O(λⁿ) instead of O(λ)."
