  "description": [
    "Linear extrapolation is the simplest method for estimating the zero-noise expectation value from noisy measurements. It fits a straight line through data points measured at different noise levels and extrapolates to where the noise level equals zero.",
    "The method assumes that the expectation value depends linearly on the noise strength: ⟨O⟩(λ) = a + bλ. This is often a reasonable approximation for small noise levels or short circuits, but breaks down when nonlinear effects become significant.",
    "Despite its simplicity, linear extrapolation is widely used in practice because it requires only two noise levels (the minimum for any extrapolation), has low variance, and is computationally trivial."

  "how_it_works": [
    "Measure the expectation value ⟨O⟩₁ at noise level λ₁ (typically the native hardware noise, λ₁ = 1).",
    "Measure the expectation value ⟨O⟩₂ at an amplified noise level λ₂ > λ₁.",
    "Fit the linear model: ⟨O⟩(λ) = a + bλ, giving b = (⟨O⟩₂ - ⟨O⟩₁)/(λ₂ - λ₁) and a = ⟨O⟩₁ - bλ₁.",
    "The zero-noise estimate is ⟨O⟩(0) = a."
